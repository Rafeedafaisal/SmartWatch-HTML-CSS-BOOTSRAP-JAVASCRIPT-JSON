HelloðŸ‘‹

This is a small smart watch demo((no backend, just UI)) that I built using Bootstrap and other basic components as part of my web development studies.

  #html5 #css #bootstrap #javascript #json  #learnbydoing

Contains :
1:Home page(contains clock)
2:message page(just a demo page)
3:stopwatch page
4:music page
(Made as an assignment that is part of the internship programme in MERN stack Development.)
